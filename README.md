# WD2-Animation-Menu
This mod allows you to trigger a wide variety of animations for your character. It features a menu with a list of over 1,000 animations you can choose from.  The menu system follows the same structure as the Nomad ScriptHook menu, simply adding a new item to its list.


📖 About This Mod
In my opinion, every open-world game deserves an animation mod — so I created this one for Watch Dogs 2.
It’s made for animation enthusiasts and roleplayers alike.

This mod allows you to trigger a wide variety of animations for your character, featuring a menu system with a searchable list of over 1,000 animations.

The menu integrates directly into Nomad ScriptHook’s system, adding itself as a new item in the list.

📦 Requirements
✅ Nomad ScriptHook for Watch Dogs 2
(This mod will not work without it)

📌 Features & Limitations
✔️ Easily trigger hundreds of in-game animations

✔️ Search bar for quick filtering

✔️ Loop animations until manually stopped

✔️ 'Stop Animation' option to break any running animation

Limitations due to engine restrictions:
Ubisoft set certain restrictions for animations in Watch Dogs 2. As a result:

Some animations will only work in specific areas or missions

Example: The ‘freehug’ animation works only near its designated NPC, Galilei animations only inside Galilei, gang animations in Oakland, etc.

Good news: Most generic animations like smoking, phone use, sitting, and idles work anywhere.

I'm actively researching ways to bypass these restrictions — any insights are welcome!

⚠️ Important Notes
Triggering a restricted animation may lock player controls
→ Use the 'Stop Animation' option in the menu to fix this.

Animations naturally stop at their cycle end

To loop, trigger the animation, then select Animation Loop
